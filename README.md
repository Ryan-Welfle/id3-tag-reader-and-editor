Final Notes

- I have included 3 sample MP3 files in the this respository
- in order to get the program to find these MP3 files (or any mp3 files of your choosing), one way to do that is to drag and drop the file-folder containing the MP3s into a Terminal/Command Prompt window to find the file path to the MP3 folder; this process is shown in my video
- the rest of the information about how to navigate this program, etc., can be found in the related .py file itself in the comments section at the header of the script

Thank you for reading!
